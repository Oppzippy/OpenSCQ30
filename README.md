## About

OpenSCQ30 is free software for controlling settings for Soundcore headphones and earbuds. It was originally intended for the Q30's, after which the project was named, but a range of devices are now supported.

### Supported Platforms

[x] Windows - Ready  
[x] Linux - Ready  
[x] Android - Ready  
[x] Web - Ready  
[ ] macOS - It compiles. It's untested beyond that. You should probably use the web client instead. I don't have a Mac, so there's not much I can do for the desktop client. If you're tring to get it working on macOS, see [btleplug macOS build notes](https://github.com/deviceplug/btleplug#user-content-macos).

### Supported Devices

It is intended that all devices in this list work, but since I do not own them all, I can not check. Please open an issue if you can confirm that any of the devices with "Unknown" status are working correctly.
