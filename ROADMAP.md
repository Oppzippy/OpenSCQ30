## Roadmap

This is a rough idea of the order in which I plan to do things. Items will be removed from the list when completed. If something is listed here, it doesn't mean it won't get done, but it does mean that it is further out in the future than the last listed item under current plans.

### Current Plans

1. CLI/GUI rewrite
2. Q45 support
3. Motion+ support
4. Liberty Air 2 support
5. Liberty 3 Pro support

### Future Plans

- Distribute GUI as an AppImage again
