* Breaking Changes
  - Custom equalizer profiles are now device specific. Legacy equalizer profiles can be migrated after connecting to a device.
  - Quick presets are now stored in a different format, and no automatic migration is available, so they must be re-created.
  - Device model auto detection is removed, so you now need to select the device model when connecting.

* Features
  - All clients now share the same database format, so it is possible to share the sqlite file amongst them.
  - Connecting to a demo device is now a runtime option rather than compile time. As an exmaple of what this can be used for, exporting a custom equalizer profile without physically having your device with you is now possible.
  - Quick presets now include any setting available for the device rather than having to add support for each setting individually.
